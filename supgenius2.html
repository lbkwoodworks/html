			<img src= "/home/john/pics/houseairbrush.png" title="yes this is the best unit of art that you have ever seen.  it has an extremely complicated origin story and took me years to complete.  it sold at auction for $10.67, which is the amount that i artistically chose for an artistic reason.  you are not worthy of it." />

			<h1 class="blue">an extremely potent art.<br />  a supple, pertinent genius. <br />  the one for our times. </h1>		
			<p>an unit of art 34 years in the making.  a trance entered and not quite left. in the desert lonely places with thinkpad, bottle of urine, locust spear.  fruitless searches for honey yielding only sand and sunset. sunsets. perhaps a smiling lizard. friendly kind. </p> 
			<h1 class="pink"> 34 years in the making.</h1>
			
			<p>one day dissapeared from his cabinet shop.  unannounced.  house door open.  peepee and poopoo in the potty.</p>
			<h2 class="orange">unflushed.  unsung.</h2> 

			<p>an artist compelled to preach his fever dream.</p> <br />
			<br />
			<h3 class="large">peever dream</h3>
			<br />
			<p>a genius shared.  a curb shat upon.</p>
